- 👋 Hi, I’m @cramhead
- 👀 I’m interested in making cool software
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting things. I know that's vague, but I'm open to lots of things. Pinning it down to a list seems unnecessarily restrictive.
- 📫 How to reach me? Well, that's a little hard. I recieve way too much spam via email, text and phone. I'm not willing to get more.
